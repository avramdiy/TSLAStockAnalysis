### 1st Commit

- Initiated data.py to load TSLA00-25.csv to analyze the HTML dataframe.

### 2nd Commit

- I need to rename the "Price" column to "Date".

- I need to remove the first two rows of the dataframe.

### 3rd Commit

- I want to create a line chart that plots the average monthly "Close" value using all dates from 2020 to 2025.

### 4th Commit

- I want to add a line plot to the same chart that plots the average monthly "Open" value using all dates from 2020 to 2025.

### 5th Commit

- In the same chart, I want to add a transparent bar chart showing the average monthly volume traded. Scaled the "Volume" data by le6 (1,000,000) to show accurate variation.
